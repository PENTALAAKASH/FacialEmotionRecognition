# 😄 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)

A deep learning-based **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)** system that detects and classifies human emotions from facial expressions in real-time using **OpenCV** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

This project demonstrates how computer vision and deep learning can be combined to recognize emotions like **Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral**, and more — directly from a live webcam feed or image input.

## 👀 Features

- 🎥 **Real-Time Emotion Detection:** Capture video from webcam and detect emotions instantly.
- 🧠 **Pre-trained CNN Model:** Trained on popular emotion datasets for high accuracy.
- 📷 **Face Detection with OpenCV:** Uses Haar cascades or DNN for facial region detection.
- 💬 **Multi-Emotion Support:** Supports a range of emotions — Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprised, etc.
- 🔌 **Easy to Run:** Plug-and-play app with minimal setup.
- 📦 **Modular Code:** Organized codebase with `src/`, `models/`, and `app.py` for clean project flow.
